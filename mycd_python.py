"""
A program simulating a "cd" Unix command.

The simulated command takes two path strings from the command line and prints 
either a new path or an error. The first path is a current directory. 
The second path is a new directory. To make it simple let's assume that 
a directory name can only contain alphanumeric characters. A single dot (".") 
indicates a current directory, and the two dots ("..") indicate a step to a 
previous directory, up from the current one. A single forward slash "/" indicates 
a root directory. Multiple consecutive slashes are treated as equivalent to a single one.

    Typical usage example:
    
    From command line:
    $ python3 mycd_python.py <current directory path> <new directory path>
    
    Call from another module:
    mycd(current_dir, new_dir)
